# Extra
If I have a whole week to work on the Outdoorsy listings search app, I can add some extra features to make the app more user-friendly and appealing.
#### For Example:
## Search Enhancements
* #### Filter and Sorting:
Allow users to filter and sort the search results based on criteria such as price, availability, location, amenities, and vehicle type.
* #### Advanced Search:
Provide an advanced search option that allows users to search for listings based on multiple criteria. For example, they could search for listings that are pet-friendly, have a kitchenette, or are wheelchair accessible.
## User Experience Improvements
* #### User Accounts:
Create a user account system that allows users to save their searches, view their search history, and receive notifications when new listings are added that match their search criteria.
* #### Reviews and Ratings:
Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for each vehicle they rent. This feature could help other users make informed decisions when renting a vehicle.
* #### Social Media Integration:
Integrate social media sharing buttons to allow users to share listings they find interesting with their friends and followers.
## Accessibility Features
* #### Multilingual Support:
Provide multilingual support to make the app accessible to users who speak different languages.
* #### Mobile Responsiveness:
Ensure that the app is mobile-friendly and responsive so that users can search for listings on their smartphones and tablets.
